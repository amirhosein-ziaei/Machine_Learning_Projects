    "*The main focus of this notebook is to develop machine learning models that can accurately classify the ***\"categories\"*** of movies or series. These models rely on a set of features that have proven to be valuable during the preprocessing stage. The project involves several significant phases, namely ***data analysis***, ***preprocessing***, ***model training***, ***optimization***, and ***prediction***. The training process will utilize ***decision tree*** and ***random forest*** algorithms as the primary methods.*"
